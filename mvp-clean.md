# CollabBoard MVP Requirements

## Checklist

- [ ] Infinite board with pan/zoom
- [ ] Sticky notes with editable text
- [ ] At least one shape type (rectangle, circle, or line)
- [ ] Create, move, and edit objects
- [ ] Real-time sync between 2+ users
- [ ] Multiplayer cursors with name labels
- [ ] Presence awareness (who's online)
- [ ] User authentication
- [ ] Deployed and publicly accessible

## Guiding Principle

A simple whiteboard with bulletproof multiplayer beats a feature-rich board with broken sync.

## Build Priority Order

1. Cursor sync — Get two cursors moving across browsers
2. Object sync — Create sticky notes that appear for all users
3. Conflict handling — Handle simultaneous edits
4. State persistence — Survive refreshes and reconnects
5. Board features — Shapes, transforms
6. Auth — User authentication
7. Deploy — Publicly accessible
